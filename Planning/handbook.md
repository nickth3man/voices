## Methodological Approach

### Hybrid Modular Architecture

The application will follow a hybrid modular approach that balances immediate functionality with long-term flexibility. This approach allows for rapid delivery of core features while establishing a foundation for future expansion.

#### Key Principles

1. **Focused Initial Implementation**: Prioritize core functionality with direct implementations
2. **Strategic Abstraction**: Create interfaces and abstractions only where future change is likely
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Build basic functionality first, then enhance iteratively
4. **Clear Component Boundaries**: Establish well-defined interfaces between major components
5. **Technology Isolation**: Contain technology-specific code to limit the impact of future changes

#### Development Methodology

1. **Iterative Development**:
   - Deliver functionality in vertical slices across the stack
   - Build minimum viable implementations first, then enhance
   - Regular integration of components to ensure cohesion
   - Frequent testing with real audio/video data

2. **Progressive Modularization**:
   - Start with direct implementations for rapid progress
   - Identify abstraction points after concrete implementations prove successful
   - Apply "Rule of Three" - abstract only after three similar implementations
   - Balance between immediate delivery and future flexibility

3. **Technical Debt Management**:
   - Regular refactoring cycles built into the development process
   - Clear documentation of design decisions and technical debt
   - Unit test coverage for critical components
   - Periodic architecture reviews to ensure alignment with goals
