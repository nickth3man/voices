## Project Overview

### Vision and Purpose

The Multi-Modal Audio/Video Processing Application is designed to process audio and video files for the purpose of isolating individual voices, identifying speakers, and organizing the processed content in a structured and searchable manner. This comprehensive guide documents all components, requirements, and implementation steps needed to realize this vision.

### Core Objectives

1. **Voice Isolation**: Extract clear voice tracks from mixed audio sources, even in challenging acoustic environments
2. **Speaker Identification**: Enable users to identify and track speakers across multiple recordings
3. **Content Organization**: Provide comprehensive tools for organizing and retrieving processed audio by speaker, date, or content
4. **Scalable Processing**: Support batch processing and efficient handling of large files
5. **Extensible Architecture**: Create a foundation that allows for future enhancements and integrations

### Success Criteria

- Successful voice isolation in 90%+ of common recording scenarios
- Intuitive interface requiring minimal training for basic operations
- Processing speed of at least 5x real-time on recommended hardware
- Reliable file management with zero data loss during normal operations
- Extensible architecture that supports addition of new features and technologies

## Core Architecture

The application follows a hybrid modular architecture that balances immediate functionality with long-term flexibility. The architecture is divided into four major components with clear interfaces between them:
