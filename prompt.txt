Create a multi-modal audio/video processing application that performs the following functions:

Input Processing:
- Accept audio files (.mp3, .wav, .aac, etc.) and video files (.mp4, .mov, .avi)
- Validate file integrity and format compatibility
- Extract audio stream from video files if necessary

Voice Isolation:
- Implement source separation algorithms to isolate distinct voices
- Filter out background noise and music
- Maintain audio quality during separation process
- Generate individual audio files for each detected speaker

Speaker Identification:
For audio-only files:
- Use voice recognition algorithms to create unique voice prints
- Compare voice prints against existing database entries
- Extract any available audio metadata

For video files:
- Implement facial recognition to detect and track speakers
- Cross-reference facial data with:
  * Video metadata
  * Social media profiles
  * Public figure databases
  * News archives
- Match facial recognition data with isolated voice tracks

File Management:
- Create standardized naming convention: [Speaker_Name]_[Date]_[Source]_[ID]
- Generate metadata tags for each file including:
  * Speaker demographics
  * Recording context
  * Confidence score of identification
  * Source material reference
- Organize files in a structured local database with:
  * Searchable indexes
  * Cross-referencing capabilities
  * Version control
  * Backup functionality

Export specifications:
- Save isolated voice tracks in high-quality audio format
- Include option for multiple export formats
- Maintain original timestamps
- Generate processing report for each session
